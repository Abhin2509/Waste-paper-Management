<p>
Globally we deforest around ten million hectares of forest every year .That’s an area the size of Portugal every year. Around half of this deforestation is offset by re-growing forests,
so overall we lose around five million hectares each year.<br>
Nearly all – 95% – of this deforestation occurs in the tropics. But not all of it is to produce products for local markets. 14% of deforestation is driven by consumers in the world’s 
richest countries – we import beef, vegetable oils, cocoa, coffee and paper that has been produced on deforested land.
The scale of deforestation today might give us little hope for protecting our diverse forests. But by studying how forests have changed over time, there’s good reason to think that a
way forward is possible.</p><br>

<h2><u>Causes of Deforestation:- </u></h2>
<p>
Conversion of forests for other land uses, including pulp, palm, and soy plantations, pastures, settlements, roads and infrastructure.<br>

1.Illegal and unsustainable logging: Illegal logging occurs in all types of forests across all continents – from Brazil to Indonesia – destroying nature and wildlife, taking away 
community livelihoods and distorting trade. Illegally harvested wood finds its way into major consumption markets, such as the U.S., and European Union, which further fuels the
cycle. <br>
2.Fuelwood harvesting: Over-harvesting for domestic use or for commercial trade in charcoal significantly damages forests.<br>
3.Mining: The impact of mining on tropical forests is growing due to rising demand and high mineral prices. Mining projects are often accompanied by major infrastructure 
construction, such as roads, railway lines and power stations, putting further pressure on forests and freshwater ecosystems. <br>
4.Climate change: Forest loss is both a cause and an effect of our changing climate. Climate change can damage forests, for instance by drying out tropical rainforests and
 increasing fire damage in boreal forests. Inside forests, climate change is already harming biodiversity, a threat that is likely to increase.<br>

<h2><u>Effects of Deforestation:</u></h2>
<p>
Forests provide many critical ecosystem services and house wildlife and people. Deforestation therefore undermines these services and deprives forest-dependent peoples of 
livelihoods and cultural connections to nature.<br>
Forests:<br>
1.help stabilize the world’s climate by sequestering carbon and affecting the reflectivity of Earth's surface.<br>
2.provide a home to the majority of the planet's plant and animal species.<br>
3.maintain the water cycle, including generating rainfall at local, regional, and trans-continental scales.<br>

Forest loss therefore:<br>
1.accelerates global warming by releasing substantial amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.<br>
2.increases biodiversity loss, including causing the extinction of plants and animals.<br>
3.disrupts rainfall patterns, including increasing the incidence of drought in some areas.<br>

<h2><u>Solutions to Deforestation:</u></h2>
<p>
Drivers of deforestation are complex and vary from region to region depending on social, economic, political, and geographic issues. This means that solutions to deforestation
are also variable — in short, there's no simple, one-stop solution to deforestation that applies worldwide. However there are some common themes that underpin efforts to 
combat deforestation. These include:<br>

1.Improve governance to curb illegal conversion and degradation of forests and reduce mismanagement of resources.<br>
2,Use full-cost accounting to incorporate the real costs of externalities and perverse subsidies that drive environmental degradation, while aligning economic incentives with 
forest-friendly practices and policies.<br>
3.Engage stakeholders in and around forest areas to determine how conservation efforts can support local livelihoods and help make land use more sustainable.<br>
4.Recognize the land rights of forest-dependent peoples to ensure the forests they traditionally use aren't taken away from them.<br>
5.Educate the public on the importance of forest ecosystems, including the services they afford.<br>
6.Take personal responsibility in how you use resources. The decisions we as consumers make have a direct impact on the fate of forests. As such, you have a powerful
 voice in asking companies what actions they are taking to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains.<br>
7.Support environmental defenders who are putting their lives and well-being on the line to protect forests.<br>
8.Communicate your concerns about forests to policymakers, companies, and your friends and family.<br>
9.Vote for representatives who support thoughtful, forest-friendly policies.<br>
